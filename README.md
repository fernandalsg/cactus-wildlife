# TYPES OF CACTUS

Thanksgiving Cactus (Schlumbergera truncata)

- Thanksgiving cactus is a long-lived type that doesn't have prickly spikes, so it can be grown around kids and pets. It can live for decades with the right care.

-It's related to Christmas cactus, which is more difficult to find because it's more fragile to ship, and Easter cactus, which has more star-shaped flowers.

- All three types need similar care with bright light and total darkness for 12 to 14 hours, starting in the fall, to rebloom.
